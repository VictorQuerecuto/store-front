'fundibula' is the name for the site/project I went with just to have something to not confuse with jorde.dev

I'm working in xampp because it's an easy all-in-one environment on windows, but this should work any way you 
use it so long as you have mysql, apache, and php (and you throw the right files in the right place, if it's 
different from how xampp is laid out).
- you can download xampp from https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html

'fundibula.sql' has the table for you to import into your machine 
(I also included the relevant part of my 'mysql' folder from xampp just in case).

Under 'htdocs/fundibula' are the php files for the webpages:
- make sure to edit db_connection to connect to your local database or the jorde.dev database
  (or use your own connection file and change the 'include' at the top of the php pages)
